# Credit card fraud detection

## About
Creating linear regression model for predicting fraud and non fraud transactions.
Model learned on kaggles' `creditcard.csv` file which contains about 250k non fraud and about 500 fraud transactions.

Final results are this:
#### for 50% test data
- 100% correct predicting non fraud transactions and 86-90% correct fraud transaction predicting with first linear regression model.
- 100% correct predicting non fraud transactions and 88% correct fraud transaction predicting with second linear regression model.
#### for 5% test data
- 100% correct predicting non fraud transactions and 74-93% correct fraud transaction predicting with first linear regression model.
- 100% correct predicting non fraud transactions and 84% correct fraud transaction predicting with second linear regression model.

## Usage

Install requirements using anaconda or pip:
```python
sklearn # for using linear models
matplotlib # for plotting results on chart
pandas # for working with data
```

## Conclusion

For better results we need more data and more details.
